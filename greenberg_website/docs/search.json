They are entitled “EGG”, “BIRD”, and “DUSTER”. These dramatic\npieces tell fascinating stories about our society, its complex nature,\nand our place within it.\n“EGG”\n\n\n\n“BIRD”\n\n\n\n“DUSTER”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first visualization comes from a student survey data set.\nStudents were asked how much exercise they got per week in hours. I\ncreated a histogram to show how this data was spread, and filled the\nbars with a color coorespinding to the number of responses in each\nbin.\n\n\n\nThe next visualization comes from the same data set. Students were\nasked their GPA and which award they would want to receive most: Nobel,\nOlympic, or Academy. The results are shown as violin plots colored and\nseparated according to which award the students would want the most.\nThis shows the spread of GPAs relative to the different answers.\n\n\n\nOur next visualization focuses on the exercise in hours per week and\npulses of the students.This hexplot shows where the students fall with\nboth these categories and some correlation of the two variables.\n\n\n\nThe next visualization is an app my group mates and I created using\nShiny. It is designed to teach students the concept of confidence levels\nand intervals by allowing them to interact with our graphics. We show\nthat as confidence level rises, so does the size of the bar that could\ninclude the true mean. If the true mean is included in the confidence\ninterval, it turns blue. Otherwise, it is orange. This helps students\nbuild intuition on this subject by interacting with the app instead of\njust reading something like a textbook. A still of our app is shown\nbelow, and the link is here: https://rconnect.bucknell.edu/content/4bc055a7-8c0e-4988-83e7-a657ace9fb16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I use a red wine dataset to explore what chemical properties good wine has, and the relationships between the chemicals themselves. In this exploratory anaysis, I look for patterns in the data, make hypothesis about which chemical properties will tend to produce th ebest wines, and test this hypothesis. I find that any chemical makeup can make great red wine, but the best wines tend to have low volitile acidity, high fixed acidity, high citric acid content, high acohol content, and high sulphate content. The data set, which can be found on Kaggle, has 12 variables and I coded an additional 3.   ",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first visualization is a histogram that describes the spread of\nhow the wines were scored on a 0-10 scale. It’s important to note that\nthere is not an equal spread of numeric scores or quality rating scores.\nLow had the most wines with mid following close behind. I combined the\nscores 3 and 4 into the very low category while the very high category\nis just wines that scored 8. This was the highest score given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a histogram of alcohol contents to give a picture of its\nspread. It has a left skew, as most wines are 9-12 percent alcohol.\nWhile not the most complicated graph, it I did want to make note of this\ndistribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization gives a good overview of the spreads and\ncorrelations of each variable in the data set with quality score. It is\nan informative look at which chemical processes show correlation with\nquality scores, which is the ultimate question I am trying to answer in\nthis analysis. Seeing the spreads is important as well- they are pretty\nwide which indicates that great wines and terrible wines share many\ncharecteristics. On average, though, some of these variables do show\ncoorelation with quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we break down these correlations more qualitatively to examine\nthem further. I used pearson correlations do determine r values with\nrespect to quality. A high score means a strong correlation, while one\ncloser to zero implies no correlation. A negative correlation means when\nthe variable increases the quality score decreases. Interestingly,\nresidual sugar is one of the worst indicators of good wine. Things like\nsulfates, alcohol content, and volatile acidity are relatively strong\npredictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s helpful to see some correlation within the variables themselves.\nTwo that have especially high correlation are density and alcohol\ncontent. Both of these have correlation with quality as well. The graph\nbelow shows both of these things. The fit line shows the relationship\nbetween wine density and alcohol content, and the color of the points\nget lighter as they move right to higher alcohol content and lower\ndensities. This represents an increase in quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitric acid and pH also are related. This facet grid shows a number\nof things about these two variables and quality. The citric acid content\nincreases with moves from basic to neutral to acidic pH. Acidic and\nneutral wines generally increase get higher ratings with higher citric\nacid content, while the basic wines are about the same with citric acid\ncontent. This implies that if a wine is going to be acidic or neutral,\nthis acidity should come from citric acid instead of another source\nwhich could result in the acidity coming in a harsher form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization is where I make predictions about what makes good\nand bad wines and test this hypothesis. Based on my visualizations, I\nguessed that the best wines would have low volatile acidity, high fixed\nacidity, high citric acid content, high alcohol content, and high\nsulfate content. If a wine was above or below the 50th percentile each\nthese variables (depending on if I thought the better wines would have a\nhigh or low concentration)they would be marked as “good” or “bad”. The\nwines that were marked good and bad needed to be in the right percentile\nfor each of the mentioned variables. The graph below shows that I was\nright in my predictions. The “good” wines fell higher in quality while\nthe “bad” wines had lower quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
